# About-me
Goals
Hey all. my names Alex. Im an avid outdoors man, love rock climbing, hiking, camping, sailing, etc. I am pretty much game for anything if it has to do with spending time outside. I have worked in the restaurant industry / construction for the last 9 years and am excited to finally be doing something new with my life. Goals are to use this program to be able to challenge myself, learn something new, and start a new career.
